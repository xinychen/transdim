    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Large-scale and multidimensional spatiotemporal data sets are becoming ubiquitous in many real-world applications such as monitoring traffic and air quality. Making predictions on these time series has become a critical challenge due to not only the large-scale and high-dimensional nature but also the considerable amount of missing data. In this work, we propose a Bayesian Temporal Matrix Factorization (BTMF) model for modeling multidimensional time series - and in particular spatiotemporal data - in the presence of missing values. By integrating low-rank matrix factorization and vector autoregressive (VAR) process into a single probabilistic graphical model, our model can effectively perform predictions without imputing those missing values. We develop efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms for model inference and test BTMF on several real-world spatiotemporal data sets (i.e., a typical kind of multivariate time series data) for both missing data imputation and short-term rolling prediction tasks. This post is mainly about BTMF and its **`Python`** implementation with an application of spatiotemporal data imputation."

    "We assume a spatiotemporal setting for multidimensional time series data throughout this work. In general, modern spatiotemporal data sets collected from sensor networks can be organized as matrix time series. For example, we can denote by matrix $Y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times T}$ a multivariate time series collected from $N$ locations/sensors on $T$ time points, with each row $$\\boldsymbol{y}_{i}=\\left(y_{i,1},y_{i,2},...,y_{i,t-1},y_{i,t},y_{i,t+1},...,y_{i,T}\\right)$$\n",
    "corresponding to the time series collected at location $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, making accurate predictions on incomplete time series is very challenging, while missing data problem is almost inevitable in real-world applications. Figure 1 illustrates the prediction problem for incomplete time series data. Here we use $(i,t)\\in\\Omega$ to index the observed entries in matrix $Y$.\n",

    "Given a partially observed spatiotemporal matrix $Y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N \\times T}$, one can factorize it into a spatial factor matrix $W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{R \\times N}$ and a temporal factor matrix $X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{R \\times T}$ following general matrix factorization model:\n",

    "The standard matrix factorization model is a good approach to deal with the missing data problem; however, it cannot capture the dependencies among different columns in $X$, which are critical in modeling time series data. To better characterize the temporal dependencies and impose temporal smoothness, a novel AR regularizer is introduced on $X$ in TRMF (i.e., Temporal Regularizer Matrix Factorization proposed by [Yu et al., 2016](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rofuyu/papers/tr-mf-nips.pdf)):\n",
